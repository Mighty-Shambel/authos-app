    2:Joy-Autism is a kind of neural development disorder in children. 0.67% of infants globally are diagnosed with this condition and itâ€™s symptomatically visible in the first 3 years of life, largely distinguished as weakening public interaction and repetitive or restricted behaviour. It alters the normal processing of information in the human brain by restricting or disturbing the organization and interconnection of nerve cells with their synapses. No certain cause or reason has been defined or suggested that may lead to the condition of Autism; neurological impairment, 
    immunological deficiency or certain environmental factors are considered as major attribution to Autism.
